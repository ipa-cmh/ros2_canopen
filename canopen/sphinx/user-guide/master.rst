Master Driver
=============

The master node handles the creation of the necessary can interface and sets up a canopen event loop which drivers can hook onto. In addition, the node offers services for communicating with nodes via nmt and sdo. The device manager will automatically spawn a master node on start-up. The master node is configured by the provided dcf file.
